# PraeclarusPDQ
Praeclarus Process Data Quality (PDQ) Framework is an environment specifically designed to detect and repair process data inconsistencies from any source.

Event logs in practice tend to suffer from significant data quality problems and these need to be recognised and resolved effectively for analysis results to be meaningful.

The framework is designed to accommodate new developments in detection and repair strategies, but also for future movement into mitigation and prevention. That is, it is built in the anticipation of new methods and strategies that go beyond current algorithms and techniques. Therefore, the key underlying principle is abstraction and extensibility, not only for data quality improvement, but also for visualisation techniques that allow analysts to intact with data in novel ways.

The framework is packaged as a Java jar file, downloadable from the Releases page, and can be run directly with ```java -jar praeclarusPDQ-X.X.jar``` (replacing ```X.X``` with the actual version number).
The latest release is currently running at http://131.181.190.49:8080/.
A demo video of the framework is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4bjcUgY9Y
